2. Ask chatty to describe in json with this prompt.```

I AM NOT INTERESTED IN WHAT ***YOU*** KNOW!!! I AM ONLY INTERESTED IN WHAT THE FOLLOWING WIKI SAYS.  ASSUME THAT THIS CONTENT BELOW IS THE ONLY THING YOU KNOW ABOUT IT!

# wiki title

ipso lorem whatever that is here... ofr the content of the article.

Do not halucinate or add new information.  Use the strengths of the multi-dimensional nature of json by having detailed parameters of the text on the page listed as sub-propertes of the objects, so that the natural language description can be as short/concise as possible.  Right now it's about 50% of the way to where it should be.  It's MUCH more structured than the original text, but it's still
A) mostly natural language (there is little parsed detail under each sentence) and
B) It is incomplete in a variety of ways.  TO BE CLEAR - I AM NOT INTERESTED IN HOW THIS JSON ABOUT CONTACT AREA COULD BE IMPROVED BASED ON WHAT YOU KNOW!!! THIS IS PURELY!!! 100% FOR THE PURPOSE OF COMPARING THAT NATURAL LANGUGE TO THE BEST JSON REPRESENTATION OF IT, THAT WE CAN MUSTER!

So... Based ONLY on the above text, rewrite using json. 
write-rewrite, or compelete the following.  

Nothing here to start with.```

## Recursive Json

Take the json and replace the `nothing here to start with` with the json it creates - and then rinse and repeat until it's consistently scoring 9's.

Ask it what's wrong - and include that after a generation.

## Fix the Json

Fix the json at a particular moment, and start asking for specific changes.
 
Have it start to suggest specific changes instead.
