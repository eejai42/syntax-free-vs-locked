# Contact area

When two objects touch, only a certain portion of their surface areas will be in contact with each other. This area of true contact, most often constitutes only a very small fraction of the apparent or nominal contact area. In relation to two contacting objects, the contact area is the part of the nominal area that consists of atoms of one object in true contact with the atoms of the other object. Because objects are never perfectly flat due to asperities, the actual contact area (on a microscopic scale) is usually much less than the contact area apparent on a macroscopic scale. Contact area may depend on the normal force between the two objects due to deformation. [1]

The contact area depends on the geometry of the contacting bodies, the load, and the material properties. The contact area between the two parallel cylinders is a narrow rectangle. Two, non-parallel cylinders have an elliptical contact area, unless the cylinders are crossed at 90 degrees, in which case they have a circular contact area. Two spheres also have a circular contact area.

Friction and contact area
It is an empirical fact for many materials that F = μN, where F is the frictional force for sliding friction, μ is the coefficient of friction, and N is the normal force. There isn't a simple derivation for sliding friction's independence from area.

Methods for determining contact area
One way of determining the actual contact area is to determine it indirectly through a physical process that depends on contact area. For example, the resistance of a wire is dependent on the cross-sectional area, so one may find the contact area of a metal by measuring the current that flows through that area (through the surface of an electrode to another electrode, for example.)

Do not halucinate or add new information. Use the strengths of the multi-dimensional nature of json by having detailed parameters of the text on the page listed as sub-propertes of the objects, so that the natural language description can be as short/concise as possible. Right now it's about 50% of the way to where it should be. It's MUCH more structured than the original text, but it's still
A) mostly natural language (there is little parsed detail under each sentence) and
B) It is incomplete in a variety of ways. TO BE CLEAR - I AM NOT INTERESTED IN HOW THIS JSON ABOUT CONTACT AREA COULD BE IMPROVED BASED ON WHAT YOU KNOW!!! THIS IS PURELY!!! 100% FOR THE PURPOSE OF COMPARING THAT NATURAL LANGUGE TO THE BEST JSON REPRESENTATION OF IT, THAT WE CAN MUSTER!

So... Based ONLY on the above text, rewrite using json.
Here are the standard on which your result will be graded:

```Stds. Based Grading - Assessment Standards:
So... Based ONLY on the text, based 100% purely on the content from that page, please grade on a scale of 1-10 how accurately this json captures the information/knowledge on that page.
- Standard 1: Completeness
- Standard 2: with No extra details not included in the original text
- Standard 3: Complex narrative language broken down into smaller parts whenever possible.
- Standard 4: All key concepts are addressed/understandable by a reasonable person.
I'm not interested in how the json could be better.  I'm interested in whether it is complete, but not extra - and broken down into it's relevant constituent points, that are successfully summarized at the high level of the grouping object/entity/concept/rule/node/fact/whatever.
