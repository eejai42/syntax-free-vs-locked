'''Coccinellidae''' ({{IPAc-en|,|k|ɒ|k|s|ɪ|'|n|ɛ|l|ɪ|d|iː}})<ref name="OED">{{cite encyclopedia |title=coccinellid |encyclopedia=The New Oxford Dictionary of English |publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] |year=1998 |isbn=0-19-861263-X |quote='''coccinellid''' /,kɒksɪ'nɛlɪd/ '''noun''' a beetle of a family (coccinelidae) that includes the ladybirds |page=351}}</ref> is a widespread [[family (biology)|family]] of small [[beetle]]s. They are commonly known as '''ladybugs''' in North America and '''ladybirds''' in the United Kingdom; "lady" refers to [[Mary, mother of Jesus|mother Mary]]. [[Entomologist]]s use the names '''ladybird beetles''' or '''lady beetles''' to avoid confusion with [[true bugs]]. The more than 6,000 described species have a global distribution and are found in a variety of habitats. They are oval beetles with a domed back and flat underside. Many of the species have conspicuous [[aposematic]] (warning) colours and patterns, such as red with black spots, that warn potential [[predator]]s that they taste bad. 

Most coccinellid species are [[carnivorous]] predators, preying on insects such as [[aphid]]s and [[scale insect]]s. Other species are known to consume non-animal matter, including plants and fungi. They are [[Promiscuity#Other animals|promiscuous]] breeders, reproducing in spring and summer in temperate regions and during the [[wet season]] in tropical regions. Many predatory species lay their eggs near colonies of prey, providing their larvae with a food source. Like most insects, they [[holometabolism|develop]] from [[larva]] to [[pupa]] to adult. Temperate species [[hibernate]] and [[diapause]] during the winter; tropical species are dormant during the [[dry season]]. Coccinellids migrate between dormancy and breeding sites.

Species that prey on agricultural pests are considered [[beneficial insects]]. Several species have been introduced outside their range as [[biological pest control|biological control]] agents, with varying degrees of success. Some species are pests themselves and attack agricultural crops, or can infest people's homes, particularly in winter. Invasive species like ''[[Harmonia axyridis]]'' can pose an ecological threat to native coccinellid species. Other threats to coccinellids include [[climate change]] and [[habitat destruction]]. These insects have played roles in [[folklore]], religion and poetry, and are particularly popular in [[nursery rhyme]]s.

== Etymology ==
The name ''Coccinellidae'', created by [[Pierre André Latreille]] in 1807,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Latreille |first1=Pierre A. |author1-link=Pierre André Latreille |title=Genera crustaceorum et insectorum secundum ordinem naturalem |date=1807 |volume=3 |publisher=Amand Koenig |pages=70–75 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/43862#page/77/mode/1up}}</ref> is derived from the Latin word {{lang|la|coccineus}} meaning {{gloss|scarlet}}.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]] |editor=Brown, L. |year=2007 |edition=6 |volume=1 |page=441 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0199231768}}</ref> The common English name ''ladybird'' originated in Britain where the insects became known as "Our Lady's birds".{{sfn|Majerus|2016|p=2}}<ref name=Majerus/> [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] ("Our Lady") was often depicted wearing a red cloak in early art, and the seven spots of the species ''[[Coccinella septempunctata]]'' (the most common in Europe) were said to represent her [[Seven Joys of the Virgin|seven joys]] and [[Our Lady of Sorrows|seven sorrows]].<ref name="Roy">{{cite book |last1=Roy |first1=Helen E. |author1-link=Helen Roy |last2=Brown |display-authors=et al |first2=Peter M.

== Description ==
Coccinellids range in size from {{Convert|0.8|to(-)|18|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Seago">{{cite journal |last1=Seago |first1=Ainsley E. |last2=Giorgi |first2=Jose Adriano |last3=Li |first3=Jiahui |last4=Ślipiński |first4=Adam |title=Phylogeny, classification and evolution of ladybird beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) based on simultaneous analysis of molecular and morphological data |journal=[[Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution]] |date=July 2011 |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=137–151 |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2011.03.015 |pmid=21426943|bibcode=2011MolPE..60..137S }}</ref> They are [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]; adult females tend to be slightly larger than males.{{sfn|Hodek|Honěk|Van Emden|2012|p=78}} They are generally oval with domed backs and flattened undersides.<ref name=Majerus/> They have large [[compound eyes]] and clubbed [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] with seven to eleven segments. The powerful [[Mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandible]]s (equivalent to jaws) typically have pairs of "teeth" which face each other.{{sfn|Majerus|2016|p=16}} The coccinellid [[prothorax]] (front of thorax) is broad and convex, and can cover the back of the head.{{sfn|Majerus|2016|p=17}}{{sfn|Hodek|Honěk|1996|p=20}} Being beetles, they have hardened, non-overlapping [[forewing]]s, known as [[elytron|elytra]], which cover up the more fragile [[hindwing]]s when the insects are not in flight. Their [[arthropod leg|legs]] are relatively short,{{sfn|Majerus|2016|p=17}} with a [[tarsal formula]] of 4-4-4 or 3-3-3.{{sfn|Hodek|Honěk|Van Emden|2012|p=3}} The [[Arthropod_leg#Tarsus|tarsus]] (end of leg) has two claws at the tip.{{sfn|Majerus|2016|p=17}} 

As adults, these beetles differ from their closest relatives with the following [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] characteristics:{{sfn|Hodek|Honěk|Van Emden|2012|p=3}} 
*Five pairs of [[Spiracle (arthropods)|spiracles]] (holes) on the [[Insect morphology#Abdomen|abdomen]] 
*A [[tentorium]] (internal supports inside the head) with separated branches at the front and no bridge
*No line dividing the [[Insect morphology#Head|frons]] and [[clypeus (arthropod anatomy)|clypeus]] (frontoclypeal suture)
*[[Insect mouthparts#Maxilla|Maxillary palps]] with non-needle-shaped tips,
*Divided [[Insect mouthparts#Maxilla|galea and lacinia]] (lobes at the end of the mouthparts)
*Smaller molar (flattened) area of the mandible 
*[[Arthropod leg#Coxa|Coxal]] cavities (holes where the leg articulates with the thorax) that open from the back in the front of the thorax and from the front in the middle of the thorax 
*Epimeron (corner plates) on the metathorax with parallel edges 
*Lines on the second abdominal [[Sternum (arthropod anatomy)|sternum]] 
*Tube-shaped, siphon-like genitalia in the male

Coccinellids are often distinctively coloured and patterned. The elytron may be light with dark spots or dark with light spots. Light areas are typically yellow, red, orange or brown, and the spots vary in size and shape and numbers. Some species have striped or [[checkered pattern]]s. The pigment [[carotene]] creates the lighter colours, and [[melanin]]s create darker colours. Other parts of the body also vary in colouration.<ref name=Majerus/>{{sfn|Hodek|Honěk|Van Emden|2012|pp=19–20}} These colour patterns typically serve as [[aposematism|warning colouration]], but some can act as [[camouflage]], attract mates or even regulate heat.<ref name=Majerus/>{{sfn|Hodek|Honěk|Van Emden|2012|p=26}} Several individual species may display [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] and even change colour between seasons.<ref name=Majerus/>

Coccinellid [[larvae]] are elongated with square heads.{{sfn|Majerus|2016|pp=36–37}} They are covered in hairs or [[setae]], the abdominal segments, in particular, each having six divided into pairs, and one to three segmented antennae.{{sfn|Hodek|Honěk|Van Emden|2012|p=3}}<ref name=Majerus/> Their colouration varies from grey, blue-grey, grey-brown or brown and spotted with white, yellow, red or orange. They tend to brighten as they get closer to adulthood.{{sfn|Majerus|2016|p=39}}
