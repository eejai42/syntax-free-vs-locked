                            "Mechanism": "The test works by comparing the molecular changes between two closely related species and an outgroup. If the evolutionary rates are consistent, the genetic distance between each of the two species and the outgroup should be the same. This was used to demonstrate that the rate of molecular changes in albumin was consistent between humans and chimpanzees. Specifically, the outgroup species is more distantly related, and the assumption is that if one lineage (species) had evolved more quickly, it would show a greater molecular difference from the outgroup compared to the other lineage. The relative rate test validates the molecular clock hypothesis by confirming that the rate of molecular changes accumulates at a similar pace in the lineages being compared.",
                            "Implication": "Fixations accumulate at a rate equal to the individual mutation rate, assuming most changes are neutral. This model supports the molecular clock by demonstrating that the rate of evolutionary change, in terms of neutral mutations, is constant over time across different lineages. This constancy is crucial for the reliability of molecular clocks in estimating divergence times based on molecular data alone.",
