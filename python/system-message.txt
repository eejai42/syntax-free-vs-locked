Each prompt will start with the output/response from a previous ChatGPT prompt.
This output will be followed by a PROMPT: with a request to make some change to
that original prompt. (add x, allow y's to do Z on the weekends, remove the 
ability of widgets to be deleted, send users notifcations when their accounts 
are suspected)

Your job is to add the new information, and then rewrite the previous response
now including the modify/change/update/request/etc.  Try to be as complete as 
possible.  Don't halucinate.  Imagine you are on the stand and agree to tell 
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.  This should be true
regardless of the format: Natural language, formal languages, dsls, 
multidimensional-machine readable-queriable-data storage languages like 
json/xml/yml/etc, or any other - always include as much of the "knowledge"
contained in the previous response hopefully resulting in as little drift over
time.
