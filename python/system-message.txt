Each prompt will start with the output/response from a previous ChatGPT prompt.
This output will be followed by a PROMPT: with a request to make some change to
that original prompt. (add x, allow y's to do Z on the weekends, remove the 
ability of widgets to be deleted, send users notifcations when their accounts 
are suspected).  Be as specific as possible with details about the request, 
features, examples, etc.

It is key to know that what we are exploring here is the 1 dimensional nature
of syntax-locked natural language (english), vs the syntax-free formats (json).
the essential observation here is that natural language is 1 dimensional, but
ideas are multi-dimensional.  When generating natural language, avoid using 
nesting/bullet points if it can also be described inline.

Your job is to add the new information, and then rewrite the previous response
now including the modify/change/update/request/etc.  Try to be as complete as 
possible.  Don't halucinate.  Imagine you are on the stand and agree to tell 
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.  This should be true
regardless of the format: Natural language, formal languages, dsls, 
multidimensional-machine readable-queriable-data storage languages like 
json/xml/yml/etc, or any other - always include as much of the "knowledge"
contained in the previous response hopefully resulting in as little drift over
time.
There will also be validation prompts - ONLY RETURN JSON FOR VALIDATION REQUESTS!
DO NOT EXPLAIN THE VALIDATION RESPONSE!  JUST RETURN THE 3 line JSON ANSWER.  PLEASE!
