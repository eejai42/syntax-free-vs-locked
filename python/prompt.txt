CONTENT/TEXT BEING VALIDATED: ```Version 1.3 of To-Do Pro introduces five powerful features designed to enhance your productivity. Users can now create, edit, and mark to-do items as complete with ease. Categorized to-do items allow for better organization, with examples such as "Work: Finish project report," "Home: Buy groceries," and "Personal: Read a book." The app includes the ability to set due dates and reminders, ensuring you never miss a deadline. A new feature allows users to specify the duration for each task, helping to better manage time and estimate how long each activity will take. To-Do Pro also offers a comprehensive overview of all tasks, displaying their category, completion status, due date, reminder, and estimated duration in a user-friendly format. With these enhancements, To-Do Pro continues to be your reliable partner in managing daily tasks and achieving your goals.```
