CONTENT/TEXT BEING VALIDATED: ```To-Do Pro Version 1.3 is a robust task management app designed to streamline your daily activities with six simple yet powerful features. It allows users to create, edit, categorize, and set durations for to-do items effortlessly. Categories include Work (e.g., "Finish project report"), Personal (e.g., "Buy groceries"), Fitness (e.g., "Go for a run"), and Errands (e.g., "Pick up dry cleaning"). Additionally, the app now includes a "duration" feature, allowing users to specify the estimated time required to complete each task (e.g., "Finish project report - 2 hours"), which aids in better time management and scheduling. The app's user-friendly interface ensures that you can prioritize and organize your tasks efficiently, helping you stay on top of your responsibilities and achieve your goals with ease. The C# script provides a class `Task` to represent individual tasks with properties for title, category, and duration. The `ToDoPro` class manages a list of these tasks, allowing for creation, editing, and display of tasks. The `Task` class includes methods for editing task details, and the `ToDoPro` class includes methods for creating and editing tasks, as well as displaying all tasks. The script demonstrates the creation of several tasks, their display, and the editing of a task, showcasing the app's functionality.```
