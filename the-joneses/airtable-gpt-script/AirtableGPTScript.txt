Because With a SIMM - a Syntax independent model of the whole project - everything downstream from that gets simpler. Much, Much, Simpler! \n\nThis is the same information, but built in a context that is completely free from syntax.\nYes - this model uses some english words - but the relationships of these family members is not coupled to a description.\nSed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem \nSed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architectoSo we can go to GPT - and simply paste in the story - and ask it to describe the family - and all that's provided are from that spreadsheet, and GPT goes ahead and writes a correct, accurate, up to date description of the family. Including all the meta data about where charlie came from\nSed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto\nSed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto\nSed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto\nBack in air, table - we can also make changes - like the introduction of Frank into the picture.  Right now - he is UNRELATED to the family. But if we just drag him up into the active group - we can then again copy/paste the details from our syntax independent model of the family - and paste it into GPT - and it will, once again, be able to create a seamless, always internally consistent description of the family - now including Frank.\nFrank is mentioned 4 times from air, table - and then GPTs description of the descriptions from air, table now include the detail that Frank might be the bio-dad.\nBack in air, table - frank was determined to be unrelated, and so we will drag him back out of the ACTIVE group.  And then - let's pretend that a new family member, maria, who plays the violin enters the family.  Once again, the stories update - and in this case, we can see that Alice is mother of the Child Maria - because They are a they - .  But if we make them a he/him the she is parent of son Maria.  And if they were a she/her - then it would be Daughter Maria Jones.  But - because they are they them - it is child maria.\nOnce again, we'll copy/paste the whole story as it currently is - and paste it into chatgpt like before.\nOnce again - it should now mention that they have 2 children - and\nAnd when we ask who Frank is - it says that there is no mention of Frank - because he's not the dad.\nWe can ask who Maria is and it tells us that as well.  Because it \"knows.\nThey/Them.\nAnd we can ask it to describe the family - and it will again, create an always internally consistent description of the whole family, including the fact that there are now 4 \"humans\" and 1 dog.  And that maria plays the violin, and uses they/them pronouns.\nBack here on the main page - let's make the other changes that happened in the previous demo.  Let's start by making Alice a Mechanic - which is what she is.\nLet's also Update Bob - because he is a teacher and also still a parent.\nCopy/paste - let's see what we get.\nOnce again we get a description of the family, but this time, we get the description of the family with Alice specifically mentioned as a mechanic, and Bob as a school teacher. Along with continuing to refer to Charlie as the owner of dingo, that he got for his 12th birthday.\nI can also now ask what they do professionally though - and it will know that they are Professionals.
