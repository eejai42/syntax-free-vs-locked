Please describe this family/situation in cypher.  Be as complete as possible. Everything should be in Chinese, even the names of people- so no English, except for cypher keywords like node.name).  I don't speak either, so just get to the code please.


Please rewrite the cypher, translating the chinese into english.



They did a dna test, and frank is actually not charlie's bio dad, bob is as originally thought.  He is just some dude unrelated to any of this.  He is not involved.  Please describe the family and events involved here in cypher text with the new details.
