Imagine what it should say at this point... on a scale of 1-5 how closely does the following participant response is what would be expected.

After all 5 prompts - this was  Participant's final Response: 

The object is a small, solid cube made entirely of plastic. Each side of the cube is square, with all six sides measuring exactly 2 inches per side. The overall structure of the cube is uniformly red, with the color consistent and even across its entire surface.

The cube has twelve edges, all of which are sharp and well-defined, creating a precise geometric form. The corners of the cube, where the edges intersect, are similarly sharp and free from any rounding or imperfections. The plastic material of the cube is lightweight but hard, giving the object a rigid and sturdy feel when handled. Despite its small size, the cube feels solid and durable.

The surface of the cube is smooth and glossy, reflecting light evenly across its surface, which contributes to a polished and shiny appearance. The design of the cube is simple and minimalistic, with no additional patterns, symbols, or variations in texture. The uniform red color and smooth surface emphasize the geometric shape of the object.

The cube has no holes, indentations, or markings; it is a solid piece of plastic, with the focus entirely on its form and consistent red color. The edges of the cube, where the faces meet, are clean and precise, completing the straightforward and elegant design of the object.
